    <h1>Classification Tree Results</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">Explore the predictors of college student placement and make predictions on whether someone will be accepted based on various independent variables. 
      <p> This project examined various predictors of college student placement. </p>
      <p> The root node (the starting point) is the communication score, which splits at 7.5 </p>
      <p> The other decision nodes include IQ (110.5), CGPA (8.005), and projects (1.5) </p>
      <p> For example, the results show us that scoring less than 7.5 on communication and having an IQ of less than 110.5 does not result in a placement (52.92% of the sample).  </p>
      <p> For another example, students who received a communication score of less than 7.5, had an IQ of greater than 110.5, a cumulative GPA of greater than 8.005, and greater than 1.5 projects do receive a placement (4.33%) </p>
      <p> The analysis (classification trees) was done in R, and the PDF from R is available to show the code used. </p>
